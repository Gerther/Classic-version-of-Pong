# Classic-version-of-Pong


This game is a classic version of Pong, where the player controls a paddle using the up/down arrows ⬆️⬇️.
Trying to hit the ball ⚽ that moves across the screen. On one side of the screen is the player 👾, and on the other side is the computer 🤖, which tracks the ball and attempts to bounce it back. If the ball passes the player's paddle, the opponent scores a point. The goal is to score more points than the computer. Both the player and the computer have equal-sized paddles 🏓, and the ball bounces off walls and paddles. The game resets once a player reaches a certain score.
